6. In ApplicationDBContext to the top of OnModelCreating method add `base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);`    
7. In Program.cs Add app.UseAuthentication(); above app.UseAuthorization();   
8. In Program.cs Add app.MapRazorPages(); above app.MapControllerRoute(..)   
9. In Program.cs Add builder.Services.AddRazorPages(); under builder.Services.AddDefaultIdentity   
10. in _Layout.cshtml add     <partial name="_LoginPartial" /> to the navigation bar.
